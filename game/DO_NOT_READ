Hi everyone!... bugs marcos saw was solve.
It was found on class "dot" one case into constructor did not have
return, now it does.
Also some bugs were fixed on class map, there were some missing cases, it
would be great if you still proving it!.
I was thinking about uploading it to facebook page "semillero de desarrollo
de videojuegos ULA", with that people will try the game and we will get feed 
back. please tell me what you think about it.
